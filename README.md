## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This data represents a technology which is in remote location. It sends data periodically on its status - Failure or not. It is very expensive to fix these machines because they are in remote areas and its failure is hard to predict.

We as researchers have to help the company predict the failure chances of such devices in the future.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

```

# ML libraries
imbalanced_learn==0.9.0
imblearn==0.0
joblib==1.0.1
pandas==1.2.4
scikit_learn==1.0.2

# packaging
setuptools==58.0.4
wheel==0.37.0

```

### Installing

Use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to download python 3.8 or higher and then

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting up PYTHONPATH

Set up python path so that python can look for modules in these directories.

```
set PYTHONPATH = "**\predict-device-failure\failure_prediction_model"
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To train a model, navigate to main folder of the project

### Training a model

```
python failure_prediction_model/train_pipeline.py
```

### Making predictions

```
python failure_prediction_model/predict.py
```

### Building the package

Build the package using setuptools and wheels for distribution.

```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

### Install the package

Now the package is ready to be installed.

```
pip install -e failure_prediction_model
```
